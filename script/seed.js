My 10 year old son loved it for a while, but now it just sits in the corner with a blank, silent stare. We had gotten the third-party, full control app for it and that was kinda cool. Never did look into doing something with the SDK - that may have been cool, but it seemed like its capacity was maxed out with that third-party app. Would be nice if MiP had more capability and customizability. My son breaks it out once in a blue moon, but sadly I think MiPs time peaked about a month after Christmas.' }),

It, or should I say he, requires a lot of room to perform the preprogrammed animations. This toy is also FAST, so any hard collisions with things in the room could disrupt his internal circuity causing possible malfunctions. This is definitely an indoor toy.

We liked the fact thats its fast and its able to move on tile floor, grass and even tried it on the street.We liked how it moved in the street but of course youll scratch it and get it dirty so do it at your own risk. Liked that it has 3 ways of controlling it you can use the control, it will follow you and voice control(limited phrases). Borg feels solid feels like it will last a long time.' }),
    Review.create({ userId: 2, productId: 17, reviewText: 'Being a family of Star War fans, this droid has been a big hit for all of us. This product is just fun. The lights and sound effects are great. There is a remote controller that can move the droid, while it makes noises and speeds around. I love the Voice recognition which works great. If you say Follow Me., the little cutie finds you and moves with you. Just give it room . He moves fast with all of the sounds and movements of Star War droids. The toy is heavy and somewhat tricky to initially set up. You must charge the head and body, put batteries in the controller and then attach the head to the body. After the first time of setting it up, it is just fun and easy to re-charge and get going' }),

      userId: 3, productId: 1, reviewText: 'In RC mode you need to make sure you have plenty of room. He has a wide turning radius and will smash into furniture. The voice response is fun.

    Review.create({
      userId: 2, productId: 8, reviewText: 'Did I mention he was fast? One thing you will want to be aware of is that if he strikes a couch or end table with enough force, the head will come off causing him to "scream" until you replace it (getting used to putting the head unit on pays off here). One other thing to note, if your floors have big transitions going from hardwood floors to a high pile carpet, you will need to have some speed to get "up" onto the carpet. From a standstill, he does have some issues getting "up" onto the carpet. But once hes on there, its smooth sailing. Going from carpet to the hardwoods is not an issue at all. When stopping on hardwoods, be sure to stop early, as he "slides" since the hard plastic shell of his body doesnt really "grip" hardwoods well.' }),

It does everything it says it does. Maybe the reason some people were disappointed in it, was they were really expecting a toy for kids.This is a top for grown-up men who love borgs. The whole family did think it was a cute borg, but the guys really enjoyed it.They had no problems with it and our grandson said hed pay for one for my husband. Its a bit silly but it gives them a great deal of entertainment. We found no problems with this and plan to buy a second one.' }),

We had no problem with them at all. The robot scooted along my thinner rug in the family room with no problem and really flew on my hardwood floors. The both have hardwood floors at their homes. I emailed both the dads to find out how they are doing 3 weeks after I gave them the toys. They are doing just great. All the kids in the house love this one! It has become a member of the family. No issues as all. They are constantly finding new things to program into him. I told the Dads I will buy them Jedi robes and laser sabers. May the force be with you too.' }),
